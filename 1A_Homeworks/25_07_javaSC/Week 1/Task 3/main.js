//Exercise 1
//`What is the equality operator in JavaScript?`
//ANSWER:There are == and ===


//Exercise 2
//== is an abstract equality
//Exemple: 1 == true
//=== is an absolute equality
//Exemple: 1 === 1

//Exercise 3
// you can use a boolean oparation to check if x === y.
// true means that they are equal, otherwise not

//Exercise 4
//It compares two numbers if one (first number) is bigger then other (second number)

//Exercise 5
//It compares two numbers if one (first number) is smaller then other (second number)

//Exercise 6
//use the combination >=

//Exercise 7
//use the combination <=

//Exercise 8
//The result will be a boolean answer: true

//Exercise 9
//The result is "false"
x = 10
y = "10"
console.log(x === y)

//Exercise 10
//The result is "true"

//Exercise 11
//Just use >, <, >= or <= to compare both strings in alphabetically order 
x = "a"
y = "b"
console.log(x<y)

//Exercise 12
//The result will be "true".
//Since Java Script reads the strings lexicographically (dictionary order),
//it is given a value for each word and boths values are compared to be given a result.
x = "apple"
y = "banana"
console.log(x < y)

//Exercise 13
//It means "diferent then"

//Exercise 14
//Since 5 is a number and "5" is a string, they are essentially not the same so the answer is "true" 
console.log(5!=="5")

//Exercise 15
//??????
console.log('apple' === 97)
