/*
Exercise 1
the basic assignment operator in JavaScript is the sign "="

Exercise 2
you set a value to a variable using "="
exemple:
x = 1;

Exercise 3
You use += to add a value to the original number
exemple
x = 10
x += 5
conso.log(x) "output: 15"

Exercise 4
same example from last exercise

Exercise 5
-= is used to substract a value from the original number
exemple
y = 13
y -= 3
conso.log(y) "output: 10"

Exercise 6
same example from last exercise

Exercise 7
same ass before but multipling insted
Exemple
z = 10
z *= 2
conso.log(z) "output: 20"

Exercise 8
done

Exercise 9
same as before but dividing insted

Exercise 10
w = 12
w /= 4
conso.log(w) "output: 3"

Exercise 11
'x = x +1' it´s more clear but takes more space in the code
'x += 1' it´s shorter but not so clear for begginers

Exercise 12
